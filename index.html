    <h1>Terms Defined!</h1>

        <li>y : The final stock price. At the time of selling.</li>

    <h1>Derivation of above equation</h1>
    <p class="derivation">
    Let's start with an amount 'x', the initial stock price at the time of purchasing stock.<br/>
    Total amount you can invest = T<br/>
    Total number of stocks bought = T / x<br/>
    <br/>
    Now say y is the final stock price of the day.<br/>
    Final amount gained/ loss = Total number of stocks * y 
                              = (T / x) * y<br/>
    <br/>
    Net profit (assuming) = Final amount at end of day - Initial amount at start of day 
                          = ( (T / x) * y ) - T 
                          = ( ( y - x ) / x ) * T 
                          = ( (diff) / x ) * T <br>
    Here diff denotes the difference = y - x<br/>
    Final profit = ( diff * T ) / x<br/>
    <br/>
    Now (diff / x) denotes %change in market. <br/>
    </p>
    <h1>Deductions made</h1>
    <p class="deduction">
        <ul>
            <li>Profit depends upon how much you have invested, which is pretty obvious</li>
            <li>Profit is only depends upon (%change) of the stock</li>
            <li>Invest only in the reliable companies.</li>
            <li>Start with low security. Less risk.</li>
        </ul>
